## Basic Linux Commands
This tutorial will assume you have a Linux OS installed, you have a Terminal window open, and you understand what a Terminal is.

For each command, use the help feature to explore available options and play around with a few of them until you are comfortable with the command.

### Basic commands 

#### pwd command (print working directory)
```bash
pwd # shows current directory
```

#### ls command (list files)
```bash
ls #list files
ls -la # list all files in long format
ls --help # get basic usage
man ls # get the manual for command to get full options
```


#### cd command (change directory)
```bash
cd Projects # move into Project directory
cd .. # move up one level from the current directory
```
