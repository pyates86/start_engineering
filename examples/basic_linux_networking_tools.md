## Notes:

* **Installation**: Most tools are pre-installed on Linux distributions or available via package managers (`apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, etc.). For example, `sudo apt install nmap` on Debian/Ubuntu.  
* **Privileges**: Many tools (e.g., `tcpdump`, `nmap`, `iftop`) require root privileges (`sudo`) to access raw sockets or network interfaces.  
* **Modern Alternatives**: Tools like `ip`, `ss`, and `nftables` are replacing older tools (`ifconfig`, `netstat`, `iptables`) in newer Linux distributions.  
* **Security Considerations**: Tools like `nmap`, `hping3`, and `netcat` can be used for malicious purposes, so use them responsibly and only on networks you have permission to scan or test.
