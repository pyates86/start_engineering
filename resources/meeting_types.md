## Common Meeting Types

This doc will describe some basic meeting types. 

### Meeting Types

#### Kickoff meetings
A kick-off meeting is the initial gathering of a project team to align on goals, roles, timelines, and expectations. It sets the tone, clarifies objectives, and ensures everyone understands the project's scope and next steps. Typically, it includes stakeholders, team members, and a project manager leading discussions on deliverables, milestones, and potential challenges.


#### Sprint planning meeting
A sprint planning meeting is a collaborative session in Agile project management, typically used in Scrum, where the team plans the work for an upcoming sprint (a fixed time period, usually 1-4 weeks). Attendees, including the product owner, Scrum master, and development team, define the sprint goal, select tasks from the product backlog, estimate effort, and commit to deliverables. It ensures clarity on priorities, roles, and timelines for the sprint.


#### Daily Scrum (or daily stand-up) meeting
A daily scrum meeting, also called a daily stand-up, is a brief, time-boxed (usually 15 minutes) meeting in Agile Scrum where the development team syncs on progress. Held daily, it involves team members answering three questions: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any blockers? Facilitated by the Scrum master, it promotes transparency, collaboration, and quick issue resolution while keeping the team focused on sprint goals.

#### Sprint retrospective meeting
A sprint retrospective meeting is an Agile Scrum session held at the end of a sprint to reflect on the process and improve future work. The team, including the Scrum master and product owner, discusses what went well, what could be improved, and actionable steps for the next sprint. It fosters continuous improvement, team collaboration, and honest feedback in a safe environment, typically lasting 1-2 hours.

#### Contingency planning meeting
A contingency planning meeting is a session where a team identifies potential risks to a project or operation and develops strategies to mitigate or respond to them. Attendees, including project managers, stakeholders, and key team members, discuss scenarios like delays, resource shortages, or technical failures, and outline backup plans, resources, and actions to minimize impact. The goal is to ensure preparedness and resilience against unforeseen challenges.


#### Incident postmortem meetings
An incident postmortem meeting is a review session held after a significant issue or disruption (e.g., system outage, security breach, or project failure) to analyze what happened, why it occurred, and how to prevent recurrence. Attendees, typically including team members, stakeholders, and sometimes leadership, discuss the incident timeline, root causes, response effectiveness, and lessons learned. The outcome is an action plan with improvements, documented for future reference, fostering accountability and continuous learning.

#### Performance review meetings
A performance review meeting is a scheduled discussion between an employee and their manager to evaluate the employee’s work, contributions, and progress over a specific period. It typically covers goals achieved, strengths, areas for improvement, and future objectives. The meeting may include feedback, performance ratings, and discussions about career development, training needs, or compensation. The aim is to align expectations, provide constructive input, and support professional growth.

#### Sprint Review
A sprint review meeting is an Agile Scrum event held at the end of a sprint to showcase the work completed to stakeholders and gather feedback. The team, including the product owner, Scrum master, and developers, demonstrates the sprint’s deliverables (e.g., features or product increments), discusses what was accomplished, and reviews the sprint’s goals. Stakeholders provide input, which may influence the product backlog for future sprints. It promotes transparency, collaboration, and alignment on the project’s direction.

#### Brainstorming
A brainstorming meeting is a collaborative session where team members generate ideas, solutions, or strategies to address a specific problem or goal. Participants, often from diverse roles, share creative thoughts in a free-flowing, non-judgmental environment to encourage innovation. A facilitator may guide the discussion, using techniques like mind mapping or round-robin input. The outcome is a list of ideas to be prioritized or refined for further action, fostering creativity and teamwork.


#### Decision-making meetings
A decision-making meeting is a focused gathering where participants evaluate options, discuss relevant information, and reach a consensus or final decision on a specific issue or course of action. Attendees typically include key stakeholders, subject matter experts, and decision-makers. The meeting involves reviewing data, weighing pros and cons, and clarifying objectives to ensure informed choices. Outcomes are documented, with clear action items assigned, to drive progress and accountability.

#### Project planning meetings
A project planning meeting is a session where the project team and stakeholders define the scope, objectives, deliverables, and timeline of a project. Attendees, including the project manager, team members, and sometimes clients, discuss tasks, resources, budgets, risks, and milestones. The meeting establishes roles, aligns expectations, and creates a roadmap (like a Gantt chart or work breakdown structure) to guide execution. It ensures clarity and commitment to the project’s success.

#### Retrospective meetings
A retrospective meeting is an Agile practice, often held at the end of a project phase or sprint, where the team reflects on their process to improve future performance. Attendees, including team members, Scrum master, and sometimes stakeholders, discuss what worked well, what didn’t, and potential improvements. Using formats like "Start, Stop, Continue" or timelines, the team identifies actionable steps to enhance collaboration, efficiency, or outcomes, fostering continuous improvement and team cohesion.

#### Team meetings
A team meeting is a regular gathering of team members to share updates, align on goals, discuss progress, and address challenges. Typically led by a team leader or manager, it covers topics like project status, task assignments, upcoming priorities, or team issues. The format can vary—stand-ups, weekly syncs, or ad-hoc discussions—depending on the team’s needs. The goal is to enhance communication, collaboration, and accountability while keeping everyone aligned and informed.

#### 1:1 Meetings
A 1:1 meeting is a private, recurring discussion between two individuals, typically a manager and an employee, to build rapport, provide feedback, and address personal or professional matters. It covers topics like performance, goals, challenges, career development, or well-being. The manager listens, coaches, and aligns expectations, while the employee shares updates or concerns. These meetings, often 30-60 minutes, foster trust, support individual growth, and ensure open communication.

#### Problem-solving meetings
A problem-solving meeting is a targeted session where participants come together to analyze a specific issue, identify its root cause, and develop solutions. Attendees, often including team members, stakeholders, or experts, discuss the problem, share insights, and evaluate options using tools like root cause analysis or brainstorming. The goal is to agree on actionable solutions, assign responsibilities, and establish timelines, ensuring the issue is resolved effectively and efficiently.

#### Stakeholder meetings
A stakeholder meeting is a gathering of individuals or groups with a vested interest in a project, initiative, or organization—such as clients, sponsors, team leads, or executives—to share updates, align expectations, and make decisions. The agenda often includes project progress, risks, milestones, or feedback to ensure stakeholder needs are met. Facilitated by a project manager or leader, these meetings foster transparency, collaboration, and consensus to keep the project or initiative on track.

#### Change control meetings
A change control meeting is a structured session to review, evaluate, and approve or reject proposed changes to a project’s scope, schedule, budget, or resources. Attendees, typically including the project manager, stakeholders, and key team members, assess the impact, risks, and benefits of the change request using a predefined change control process. Decisions are documented, ensuring alignment and minimizing disruptions while maintaining project integrity and objectives.

#### Project review meetings
A project review meeting is a session to assess a project’s progress, performance, and alignment with objectives. Attendees, including the project manager, team members, and stakeholders, discuss milestones, deliverables, budgets, risks, and any issues. The meeting evaluates whether the project is on track, identifies corrective actions if needed, and ensures stakeholder expectations are met. Outcomes are documented to guide next steps and maintain accountability.

#### Project status meeting
A project status meeting is a recurring gathering to update the project team and stakeholders on the project’s progress. Led by the project manager, attendees review completed tasks, current activities, upcoming milestones, budget status, and any risks or issues. The meeting ensures alignment, addresses blockers, and confirms everyone understands the project’s trajectory. Outcomes include action items and updated plans, fostering transparency and accountability.

#### All-hands meeting
An all-hands meeting, sometimes called a 'town hall' or 'forum', occurs when all employees in an organisation, including managers and stakeholders, gather to discuss matters concerning that company. They can be in-person or virtual meetings.

#### Client meeting
Client meetings are one of the primary ways you can communicate with clients, set expectations and form professional relationships. They allow you to efficiently pitch a topic or discuss other subjects with clients without having to wait for a reply to an email or call.
