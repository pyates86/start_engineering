# Networking Concepts

Networking in IT refers to the interconnection of devices to enable communication, data sharing, and resource access. Below is a concise description of the main networking concepts:

### Ports and Protocols
Rules governing data exchange.

### TCP vs UDP

### OSI Model

### TCP Handshake

### SSH

### Network Topology  
The arrangement of devices in a network (e.g., star, bus, ring, mesh). Defines how nodes (computers, routers) are physically or logically connected, impacting scalability and fault tolerance.

### IP Addressing  
Unique identifiers (IPv4 or IPv6) assigned to devices for communication. Subnetting divides networks for efficiency, while public/private IPs manage internet vs. local access.

### LAN, WAN, and Other Network Types  
LAN: Local Area Network, connecting devices in a small area (e.g., office).  

WAN: Wide Area Network, spanning large distances (e.g., the internet).  

Others: MAN (Metropolitan), PAN (Personal), VPN (secure remote access).

### Routing and Switching  
Routing: Directing data between networks using routers, based on IP addresses and routing protocols (e.g., BGP, OSPF).  

Switching: Connecting devices within a network using switches, forwarding data based on MAC addresses.

### Firewalls and Security  
Firewalls filter traffic to protect networks from unauthorized access. Other concepts include encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS), intrusion detection, and secure protocols (e.g., VPNs).

### Bandwidth and Latency  
**Bandwidth:** The maximum data transfer rate (e.g., Mbps).  
**Latency:** The delay in data transmission, affecting performance.

### DHCP and NAT
DHCP: Dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices.  
NAT: Translates private IP addresses to public ones, enabling multiple devices to share a single public IP.

### Wireless Networking  
Uses Wi-Fi (e.g., 802.11 standards) for cable-free connectivity. Involves access points, SSIDs, and security protocols (e.g., WPA3).

### Network Devices  
Routers: Connect different networks.  

Switches: Connect devices within a network.  

Access Points: Enable wireless connections.  

Modems: Convert signals for internet access.

### Packet Switching  
Data is broken into packets, sent independently, and reassembled at the destination. Enables efficient, fault-tolerant communication (used in the internet).

### VLANs (Virtual LANs)  
Logically segments a physical network for improved security and traffic management without additional hardware.

### Load Balancing  
Distributes network traffic across multiple servers to optimize performance and prevent overloads.

### QoS (Quality of Service)  
Prioritizes certain types of traffic (e.g., VoIP) to ensure performance for critical applications.
