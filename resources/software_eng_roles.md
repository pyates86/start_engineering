# Software Engineering Roles

Software engineering roles vary based on specialization, responsibility, and focus within the development lifecycle. Below is a list of common roles with short descriptions:

## Frontend Developer
Focuses on building user interfaces and client-side functionality using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular). Ensures applications are visually appealing and responsive.  

## Backend Developer  
Handles server-side logic, databases, and APIs using languages like Python, Java, Ruby, or Node.js. Manages data storage, security, and application performance.  

## Full-Stack Developer  
Works on both frontend and backend, building end-to-end solutions. Proficient in both client-side and server-side technologies, ensuring seamless integration.  

## Mobile Developer  
Specializes in building applications for mobile platforms (iOS, Android) using Swift, Kotlin, or cross-platform frameworks like Flutter or React Native.  

## DevOps Engineer  
Bridges development and operations, focusing on CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure), and automation tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to ensure scalable, reliable deployments.  

## Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) 
Ensures system reliability, scalability, and performance through monitoring, incident response, and infrastructure optimization, often using tools like Prometheus or Grafana.  

## Software Architect  
Designs high-level system structures, defining technical standards, frameworks, and patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and alignment with business goals.  

## Data Engineer  
Builds and maintains data pipelines, warehouses, and ETL processes using tools like Apache Spark, Hadoop, or SQL to enable data accessibility for analytics and machine learning.  

## Machine Learning Engineer  
Develops and deploys ML models, integrating them into applications. Uses frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch and focuses on model training, optimization, and productionization.  

## Security Engineer  
Protects systems from vulnerabilities and threats by implementing secure coding practices, conducting penetration testing, and managing compliance (e.g., OWASP, GDPR).  

## QA Engineer / Test Engineer 
Ensures software quality by designing and executing manual or automated tests (e.g., Selenium, JUnit). Identifies bugs and verifies functionality against requirements.  

## Embedded Systems Engineer  
Develops software for hardware devices (e.g., IoT, automotive systems) using low-level languages like C or C++, focusing on performance and resource constraints.  

## Game Developer
Builds interactive games using engines like Unity or Unreal Engine, specializing in graphics, physics, and gameplay mechanics, often with C\# or C++.  

## Technical Lead / Engineering Manager  
Leads a team of engineers, overseeing project delivery, mentoring developers, and aligning technical decisions with business objectives.  

## Product Engineer  
Focuses on building user-centric products, collaborating closely with product managers and designers to deliver features that meet customer needs.  

## Cloud Engineer  
Designs and manages cloud-based infrastructure and services, leveraging platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure to ensure scalability and cost efficiency.  

## Blockchain Engineer  
Develops decentralized applications and smart contracts using platforms like Ethereum or Solana, focusing on cryptography and distributed systems.  

## AI Engineer  
Builds AI-driven systems, integrating models for tasks like natural language processing, computer vision, or recommendation systems into production environments.

Each role requires a mix of technical skills, collaboration, and problem-solving, with overlap depending on the organizationâ€™s size and structure. Some roles (e.g., full-stack, DevOps) may blend responsibilities, especially in smaller teams.
